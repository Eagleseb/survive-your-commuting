# Survive your commuting

# Abstract
Road traffic safety is a major societal issue costing up to 4% of a country's GNP, while traffic crashes are said to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030. The 2017 European Commission Fact sheet shows how the United Kingdom is a leader in road safety with 27 fatalities per millions of habitants while France stands slightly above average with 57. 
Whatâ€™s more, the United Kingdom provides their traffic reports for the past 30 years, what can it tell about the implementation of road safety policies ? Can this data explain the gap between France and the UK ? While it is well known that the majority of road accidents happens while commuting, can the figures prove it ?
Therefore, our goal is to extract information from the UK dataset to put common road safety beliefs into perspectives whether it is about driving conditions or the likelihood of being a casualty.

# Research questions
- What are the major risk factors?
- Who is more likely to be a casualty ?
- To what extent is it more dangerous in urban areas compared to rural ones?
- When and where is it safer to drive?

# Dataset

We found three datasets consistent with our goal, and we decided to use the one provided by the United Kingdom. The three of them have a great list of features but only UK provides a massive amount of data for many different years.

- **UK dataset:**  From year 1979 to current year. Available at https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data
- **France dataset:** Only 60.000 entries, for 2015. But help on the website. Available at https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/accidents-corporels-circulation-2015%40public/
- **Geneva canton dataset:** 22.000 entries from 2010 to december 2017. Available at https://ge.ch/sitg/fiche/8139

For each year, the entries are divided in three datasets, one for the accident, one for the casualties and a last one for the vehicles manufacturer and model. Those three datasets are linked by an Accident_index. For instance, the 2014 UK casualties dataset contains the following entries: Accident_Index, Location_Easting_OSGR, Location_Northing_OSGR, Longitude, Latitude, Police_Force, Accident_Severity, Number_of_Vehicles, Number_of_Casualties, Date, Day_of_Week,Time, Local_Authority_(District) Local_Authority_(Highway), 1st_Road_Class, 1st_Road_Number, Road_Type, Speed_limit, Junction_Detail, Junction_Control, 2nd_Road_Class, 2nd_Road_Number, Pedestrian_Crossing-Human_Control, Pedestrian_Crossing-Physical_Facilities, Light_Conditions, Weather_Conditions, Road_Surface_Conditions, Special_Conditions_at_Site, Carriageway_Hazards, Urban_or_Rural_Area, Did_Police_Officer_Attend_Scene_of_Accident, LSOA_of_Accident_Location. Most columns are categorical and all the data variables are coded rather than containing textual strings and a "lookup table" is provided. Thus, making the data science work much easier.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- **Clean** the UK dataset for the past 10 years.
- **Visualize** the data using plots and maps (_matplolib_ and _folium_) to get to know the data.
- **Detect** correlations and trends between features such as the frequency, the weather, the severity etc. 
- **Identify and quantify** the impact of several road safety related policies specific to the UK 

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 3
- **Characterize** road accidents and their casualties 
- **Compare** with the conclusions of the official Government Reports (see links)
- **Analyse** press article to extract a few "common beliefs"
- **Assess** to what extent common beliefs are true, according to the data: fact checking
