# Abstract

Road safety is a major societal issue, resulting in at least one million deaths per year and can cost up 4% of a country's GNP. What's more, it is said to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030 unless action is taken. The European Commission Fact sheet for the year 2017  shows how the United Kingdom appears to be a leader in road safety with 27 fatalities per millions of habitants while France stands slightly above average with 57 deaths per millions of habitants.

What about switzerland ? Or do we focus on UK ?
