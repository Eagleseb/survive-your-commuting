# Abstract
Road traffic safety is a major societal issue costing up to 4% of a country's GNP, while traffic crashs are said to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030. The 2017 European Commission Fact sheet  shows how the United Kingdom is a leader in road safety with 27 fatalities per millions of habitants while France stands slightly above average with 57. 
Whatâ€™s more, the United Kingdom provides their traffic reports for the past 30 years, what can it tell about the implementation of road safety policies ? Can this data explain the gap between France and Uk ? While it is well known that the majority of road accidents happens while commuting, we strongly believe there is much more to know about the circumstances and the reasons of road accidents. 
Therefore, our goal is to extract information from the UK dataset to highlight the consequences of the implementation of several policies related to road safety, enabling us to provide directives to follow the lead of the UK.

# Research questions
- What are the major risk factors? 
- How could they be attenuated?
- To what extent is it more dangerous is urban areas ?

# Dataset

We found three datasets consistent with our goal, and we decided to use the one provided by the United Kingdom. The three of them have a great list of features but only UK provide data for different year.

- **UK dataset:**  From year 1979 to current. Available at https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data
- **France dataset:** Only 60.000 entries, for 2015. But help on the website. Available at https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/accidents-corporels-circulation-2015%40public/
- **Geneva dataset:** 22.000 entries for year 2015. Available at https://ge.ch/sitg/fiche/8139


List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.


# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
- **Clean** the UK dataset for the past 10 years.
- **Visualize** the data using plots and maps (_matplolib_ and _folium_) to get to know the data.
- **Detect** correlations and trends between features such as the frequency, the weather the gravity etc. 
- **Identify and quantify** the impact of several road safety related policies specific to the UK.
