                <h2>Why road safety?</h2>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    Road traffic safety is a major societal issue costing up to <b>4% of a country's GNP</b>, while
                    traffic crashes are said to become the <b>fifth leading cause of death by 2030</b>. The 2017
                    European Commission Fact sheet shows how the United Kingdom is a leader in road safety with 27
                    fatalities per millions of habitants while France stands slightly above average with 57. What’s
                    more, the United Kingdom provides their traffic reports from 2005 to 2015.. While it is well known
                    that the majority of road accidents happens while commuting, can the figures prove it ? Therefore,
                    our goal is to extract information from the UK dataset to put common road safety beliefs into
                    perspectives whether it is about driving conditions or the likelihood of being a casualty.

                <p class="lead mb-5">
                    Once you dive in this dataset, you soon realize that there are a lot of interesting leads: specific
                    places and accidents, hypotheses on drivers or vehicles to check … Yet, time is the limit.
                    Therefore, after getting familiar with the datasets and the road safety situation in the United
                    Kingdom, we decided to focus on studying the correlation between our features and the number of
                    casualties. In doing so, we encountered several interesting outliers that we decided to investigate
                    to get to the bottom of the story. Finally, we provide some indications to justify well-known car
                    insurance bonuses.

                <p class="lead mb-5">In order to visualize the repartition of road accidents in the UK, we plot a sample
                    of the accidents on a map. We were looking for specific trends or localization that would appear as
                    more accident-prone than others. </p>

                <p class="lead">Most accidents seem to be located within cities or their urban areas, especially
                    around London. There are also many accidents on the roads between major cities, for instance the
                    area between Manchester, Liverpool and Preston in the North of England. Consequently, a deeper
                    analysis of the distribution of accidents in rural or urban areas was necessary. Actually, according
                    to our data 40% of the accidents still happen in rural areas. Moreover, this value has not changed
                    significantly for the last 10 years: this trend is <b>constant over time</b>.</p>

                <h4 class="">Speaking of time and evolution, let’s have a glance at the number of
                    casualties from
                    2014 to 2016:</h4>

                <p class="lead mt-3">As expected, we can see that the number of casualties has decreased linearly over
                    the
                    years except for a little bump in 2014. What is even more interesting is when we compare this
                    evolution,
                    to the evolution of the <b>traffic itself which increased by more than 5%</b> over the same period
                    of
                    time. This shows that this significant decrease over the years is not due to lower traffic but to
                    the
                    policies and the technical upgrades made to the vehicles !

                <p class="lead">One last thing that we thought interesting to look at from a global
                    viewpoint was the repartition of the casualties on the entire period from 2004 to 2016 :</p>
                <div class="col-lg-12 mx-auto"><img src="./img/casualties_classes.png" width="100%"

                <p class="lead">The first observation that we can make is that passengers make for around 25% of the
                    casualties of the accidents, with most of them being car passengers rather than coach ones.
                    Moreover, <b>pedestrians represent more than 10% of the casualties</b>, which seems to be a very
                    significant part as they can only be impacted in specific circumstances in urban areas. Finally, we
                    see that casualties still mainly concerns drivers and rivers, that means people who are active when
                    on the road and who could have possibly taken steps to avoid the accident. This could be explicated
                    by two main facts: the high proportion of people taking their car alone, to commute for instance and
                    the increasing part of bike riders having road accidents. Despite this context, the government has
                    still taken no action to make wearing helmets compulsory for bike users.

                    less accidents? Or on the opposite, more cars on the road entails more accidents? We used our data
                    to demonstrate the second proposition. While the trend looks alike for week days there is a huge
                    difference with week-ends.</p>

                <p class="lead mt-3">Rush hours are blatant at 8am and around 5pm, plus it is interesting to notice that
                    the peak lasts longer in the afternoon: are people tired and thus less alert ? While on week-ends,
                    people seem to be moving around lunch and tea time (do not forget we are talking about UK!).
                    <br>
                    In order to understand whether accidents related to commuting are due to traffic jams or just to the
                    increase of drivers on the road, we compared rush hour in urban and rural areas during week days and
                    week-ends.

                <p class="lead">As one can see, rush hours are still seeable in rural areas even though they are less
                    pronounced than for urban areas. What is interesting is that the difference between rural and urban
                    areas decrease on Sunday: are people going to the countryside on Sunday ?
                    <br><br>
                    On the whole, reducing the number of vehicles involved in rush hours could led to a significant
                    decrease of the number of accidents: commuting at odd hours (10am - 8pm for instance) is safer than
                    commuting “like everyone else”.

                <h2>On the impact of weather</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    The common knowledge says that driving when the weather is poor is more dangerous.
                    Therefore, we tried to try to spot a difference in the number of accidents when the weather is poor
                    or not.
                    The problem is we do not know how often the weather is bad and therefore we do not have any proper
                    normalization.
                    For that reason we plot the average number of casualties per accident given many different weather
                    condition:
                </p>
            </div>

                <p class="lead">
                    But that plot show that there isn’t much difference between different weathers.
                    The second step was to find the most dangerous locations in the UK and to compute the
                    frequencies of accidents when the weather is bad at these dangerous locations:

                <p class="lead">
                    The plot show that there is mostly no difference across these different locations, telling us that
                    they are
                    not
                    more dangerous when the weather is bad. However there is a clear outlier that merits further work.
                    It corresponds to the location (51.498, -0.497) which we checked on Google Maps:

                <p class="lead">
                    And the funny thing is that we discovered that this location was indeed particularly dangerous and
                    that
                    during bad weather it could be particularly difficult for a car on the right lane to be able to
                    enter
                    the road… So, act up UK!

                    Every driver has to be covered by a car insurance of which fares are a very sensitive topics,

                    enabling the computation of the likelihood of having a car accident. For instance, some insurances
                    offer bonuses for female driver: to what extent can our data support this advantage ?
                    <br>
                    From 2005 to 2015, data shows that female drivers almost have half as much car accident than male
                    drivers, justifying a bonuses for car insurance companies. Yet, we can not conclude that it is safer
                    to drive for women, because the difference in the number of accident could be explained by a
                    difference in the number of driver: are men driving twice as much as women ?

                        justified by our dataset: young drivers even belong to one of the less accident-prone
                        categories.
                        However insurance companies own data about the proportion of young adult driving and can,
                        therefore,
                        draw a more relevant conclusion. Once again, we lack data to properly <b>normalize</b> our

                        Similarly, there is a burst in the number of accident for urban-originated driver which could
                        be
                        taken into account by insurances: depending on where you learn to drive and where you
                        predominantly
                        drive.

                    In a nutshell, this data is <b>highly valuable for insurance companies</b> because it helps
                    computing the likelihood of car accident for a driver depending on several characteristics. Combined
                    with the frequency of insured drivers it can build <b>a relevant overview of at-risk-drivers</b>.
                    One also has to notice that combining such data can be quite <b>intrusive</b> for insured persons
                    and goes against the concept of sympathy behind insurance.
